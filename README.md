# QML

A quantum machine learning scheme according to [Microsoft's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00633.pdf).

[Corresponding implementation in Microsoft's Q# libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/libraries/machine-learning/)

The difference is that this project isn't actually simulating a quantum computer
and sampling probabilites. That's horribly slow. They also have a nonsensical
way of selecting the bias parameter.
